      Companies House personal code</h1>
     
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What a Companies House personal code is</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This is an 11 character code that is given to a person once they’ve verified their identity.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The code is personal to you, not your company or the company you work for.</p>  

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you need a personal code/what to do with it</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will need to use your Companies House personal code to connect your verified identity to our records. This is so that we know the correct person is linked to the name we have on file.  </p>
     
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping your code secure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You may need to share this code with people who file on your behalf, or for your company. Only share the code with people you trust.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Keep this information secure, as you would with other unique codes such as your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) for HMRC.</p>  

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Explaining the difference between personal code and authentication code</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your personal code is not the same as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-authentication-codes-for-online-filing" class="govuk-link">company authentication code</a>. If you have an authentication code, you should continue to keep this safe.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where to find the Companies House personal code</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This is an 11 character code that is given to a person once they have verified their identity.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can find your code in the ‘Manage account’ section of your Companies House account. You’ll need to sign in using the email address you provided when you verified.</p>
